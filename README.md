    user	I need to solve the equation 3x + 11 = 14. Can you help me?
    assistant	Certainly, Jane Doe. To solve the equation (3x + 11 = 14) for (x), you'll want to isolate (x) on one side of the equation. Here's how you can do that:
    Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation to get (3x = 3).
    Then, divide both sides by 3 to solve for (x).
    Let me calculate the value of (x) for you.
    assistant	The solution to the equation (3x + 11 = 14) is (x = 1).
